ðŸš€ Enhancing MLOps with GitOps: Integrating ArgoCD for Efficient CI/CD in Kubernetes

As part of my master's project at Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg (FAU), I developed an advanced AI application deployment platform leveraging GitOps principles and Kubernetes orchestration using ArgoCD. This project, categorized under the Application pillar, aimed to streamline and optimize the lifecycle of machine learning model deployment.

By integrating Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and Continuous Training (CT), the system addressed the complex requirements of maintaining up-to-date ML models and containerized AI workloads in dynamic environments. I would also like to thank [Benedikt](https://github.com/bensch98) for his supervision and support throughout the project.

**Key areas of focus:**

Automating deployment workflows with GitOps and ArgoCD
Managing Kubernetes clusters with Argo Rollouts and ArgoCD Image Updater
Improving reliability, scalability, and maintainability of AI systems



- **Focus Areas & Achievements:**

  - Automated deployment workflows using GitOps and ArgoCD to achieve declarative, version-controlled, and auditable CI/CD pipelines for AI/ML workloads.
  - Managed Kubernetes clusters with Argo Rollouts and ArgoCD Image Updater, automating container image updates and ensuring safe rollouts of new model versions and dependencies.
  - Designed and documented multiple deployment strategiesâ€”Rolling, Recreate, Blue-Green, and Canaryâ€”tailored for ML pipelines with stateful components and seamless version transitions.
  - Improved reliability, scalability, and maintainability of AI systems by implementing operational best practices like automated rollbacks, health monitoring, and secure multi-cluster management.
  - Developed custom tooling and operational workflows to enhance application observability, management, and recovery, enabling consistent and dependable AI service delivery.

ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. This project allows users to manage application deployments and configurations in a Kubernetes cluster using Git repositories as the source of truth.

## Features

- **GitOps Workflow:** Declaratively define and manage Kubernetes resources using Git.
- **Automated Sync:** Automatically synchronize the state of your applications in the cluster to match the configuration defined in Git.
- **Visual Dashboard:** Web-based UI for managing and visualizing application deployments.
- **Access Control:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for secure and controlled operations.
- **Multi-Cluster Support:** Manage applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
- **Health Status & Monitoring:** Real-time status and health tracking for deployed applications.
- **Custom Resource Support:** Extensible to support custom Kubernetes resources and workflows.


## Use Cases

- Continuous delivery for Kubernetes applications.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployments.
- Automated rollback and self-healing of applications.
- Secure and auditable change management.

# How To Install ArgoCD
## Requirements
Installed kubectl command-line tool.
Have a kubeconfig file (default location is ~/.kube/config).
### 1. Install Argo CD

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
This will create a new namespace, argocd, where Argo CD services and application resources will live.
